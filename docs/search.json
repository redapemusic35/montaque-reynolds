In my research, I demonstrate that narrative also enhances emotional bonds among a community’s members. I argue that narratives are crucial to culture, identity, and community, each of which are essential for well-being and as such, are a source of moral knowledge.\n            My research has two components. First, it explores the relationship between moral knowledge and popular narratives, particularly those found within music. The second component uses tools often used by data analysts, such as sentiment analysis, it looks to deconstruct linguistic corpuses, and to contrast the emotional features of a given corpus in response to moral kind terms in the expression of human relationships.\n            Adopting a broadly sentimentalist moral perspective, I build upon the insights of narrative scholars like Eleonore Stump (2020), Martha Nussbaum, Mohamad Syed and Kate McLean, and digital humanists like Marc Alfano. I propose an account where human well-being plays a vital role in questions of moral knowledge. As such, I am primarily interested in moral epistemology and cognitive psychology. This means that I primarily ask questions about actual sources of moral knowledge.\n            On this website, you can find links to my curriculum vitae, dissertation abstract, and some projects that I am currently working on.

      "contents": "\nDue to frequent moves as a child, I seldom had the opportunity to form lasting connections. Then, literature provided me with something like a semblance of a lasting connnection. Since then, philosophy has provided me with a sense of community and solidarity, which has inspired my passion for education.\nIn my course work, I aim to cultivate a culture of scholarship. My research explores the relationship between moral knowledge and popular narratives, particularly those found within cultural artifacts. Drawing on Susan Ambrose’s (2010) principle that prior knowledge shapes learning, I aim to connect students’ sociological experiences with their existing knowledge in my teaching.\nIn the following interactive and downloadable document, I articulate my teaching philosophy, experiences, and future aspirations.\n\n\nEvaluations\nHere, you will find some teaching evaluations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
