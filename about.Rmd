My research asks the primary question about the relationship, if any, between moral knowledge and popular narratives, especially those found in music. Following individuals such as Robert Hopkins (2008); Nomy Arpaly (2004); David Enoc (2009); and Laura Callahan (2008); Jesse Prinz and Michael Slote who have defended ethical theories such as emotionism, or sentimentalism, I explore various claims surrounding the notion that these explanations infer connections between our emotions and our moral judgments. 

I attempt to ground this research in well-being by referencing psychological studies, e.g. Stump 2020 and Nussbaum 1991 that often point out that narratives are important for building a community by strengthening the emotional attachments of its members and in the psychological literature on narratives, e.g., Bruner 1991, where narratives are important in that they inform us of who we are, give our lives meaning, and offer us counter narratives to mitigate the corrosive effects of stereotype threat.

From 2019--2021, I was assistant to the editor for the academic journal *Res Philosophica*, where I edited journal submissions checking them for style compliance, created bibliographies by converting docx, plain text files into  LaTex.

From 2021--2022I was a member of *Feminist X-Phi* an experimental research collaboration hosted at CUNY Graduate Center. In addition to presenting my own research on a regular basis, I also worked with other members on  their empirical projects.

In 2022, I was a research assistant in the *Walter J. Ong Center for the Digital Humanties*. As part of the one year research assistantship in, I delivered various talks on tools for annotating objects for machine learning, comparing sentiment analysis algorithms in python and R.

In my spare time, I maintain a tutorial website for using sentiment analysis in data science to understand emotional expression in popular media, mainly popular songs, play video games with my son, create plays and shows with my daughter, watch our newest addition learn to stand and eat by himself and go on walks with my wife.

# Dissertation Abstract

My dissertation addresses two central questions for moral epistemologists and cognitivists. According to (1), moral testimony is untenable. Epistemologists Alison Hills (2009, 2013) and Sarah McGrath (2018), have published a worry that accepting or acting on moral testimony, while potentially valuable, cannot be justified. Moral actions that are based on moral testimony would have no moral worth. A number of explanations have been given as to why this is the case. However, some of the more plausible explanations share an important feature with the second central question. We often expect active agency in the context of moral behavior. It is not enough that we act rightly, but our action ought reflect our understanding regarding the correct action. Moral reflection unlike non-moral reflection however, requires a richer form of understanding involving both cognitive and non-cognitive faculties. The right emotion ought accompany our moral action. Like (1), (2) also concerns emotions. We have emotions toward fictions, however, these do not always mirror those we have in the real world. In some situations, our emotional responses to fictions are apt though they are inapt outside of such contexts, e.g., slap-stick comedy. The right emotion need not accompany the audience of art. Jonathan Gilmore (2021) argues that our emotions towards a given fiction is often justified just in case the emotion was the one intended by the author. The second problem concerns the aptness of an expressed emotion.

In chapter 2, I examine the relationship between fiction and the more robust form of moral understanding important for attributions of moral worth. I contrast standard epistemological cases with moral epistemological ones. Chapter 3 explores philosophical accounts of narrative. Following notable optimists in the literature on moral testimony, such as Eleanor Stump and Martha Nussbaum, I argue that narrative is a potential avenue for achieving affective moral understanding. I define affective moral understanding as feeling the right way at the right time in response to the right object. The philosophy of psychology addresses those concerns in moral epistemology regarding the importance of moral narratives. In chapter 4, I look at psychological accounts of narrative. I focus on a class of such accounts that draw a connection between narrative understanding and human flourishing. Finally, in chapter 5, I consider whether literary narratives central to human flourishing are necessarily classical works of literature. The question about apt emotional expression and art is often articulated as a form of moral enhancement. Art is said to have the ability to make us better persons. For instance, Elizabeth Glaskill’s “Mary Barton” is often credited with motivating the expanded public health care and other social goods that the United Kingdom provides. However, rarely is popular music discussed. Yet, it is likely that a greater proportion of a given population consume popular music rather then classical literature. I argue this raises a problem: if only classical works are central to human flourishing, then only classical works can potentially undermine human flourishing. So I expand my investigation to consider a class of non-classical works, namely popular narratives. Analyzing these narratives, I develop a model of non-classical literary works that satisfy both philosophical and psychological accounts of the close connection between narrative and human flourishing.
