Welcome to my website.

I am a fifth year PhD Candidate in the Department of Philosophy at Saint Louis University. I am primarily interested in moral epistemology and cognitive psychology. This means that I primarily ask questions about actual sources of moral knowledge.

On this website, you can find links to my curriculum vitae, dissertation abstract, and some projects that I am currently working on. Send me an email or message on Discord if you would like to talk over coffee sometime.
