Welcome to my website.

I am a fifth year PhD Candidate in the Department of Philosophy at Saint Louis University.

Narratives shape our self-identity and infuse our lives with meaning, thus constituting a key component of psychological development. In my research, I demonstrate that narrative also enhances emotional bonds among a communityâ€™s members. I argue that narratives are crucial to culture, identity, and community, each of which are essential for well-being and as such, are a source of moral knowledge.

My research has two components. First, it explores the relationship between moral knowledge and popular narratives, particularly those found within music. The second component uses tools often used by data analysts, such as sentiment analysis, it looks to deconstruct linguistic corpuses, and to contrast the emotional features of a given corpus in response to moral kind terms in the expression of human relationships.

Adopting a broadly sentimentalist moral perspective, I build upon the insights of narrative scholars like Eleonore Stump (2020), Martha Nussbaum, Mohamad Syed and Kate McLean, and digital humanists like Marc Alfano. I propose an account where human well-being plays a vital role in questions of moral knowledge. As such, I am primarily interested in moral epistemology and cognitive psychology. This means that I primarily ask questions about actual sources of moral knowledge.

On this website, you can find links to my curriculum vitae, dissertation abstract, and some projects that I am currently working on. Send me an email or message on Discord if you would like to talk over coffee sometime.
