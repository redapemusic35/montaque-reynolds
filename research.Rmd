I am primarily interested in questions about moral knowledge and their sources. I typically ask questions in moral epistemology, and [agency]("https://philpapers.org/rec/CHAAPA-15#:~:text=Adaptive%20preferences%20have%20been%20extensively,and%20other%20conditions%20of%20oppression."), especially regarding moral testimony as testimony about one's moral identity. I specifically look at areas of popular forms of art, asking what these may say about the various suggested ways in which one may find an identity.
