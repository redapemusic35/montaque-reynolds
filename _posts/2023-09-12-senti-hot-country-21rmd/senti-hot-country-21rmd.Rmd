## Some Basics 

First, I should point out that much of the content in this section will be based on the book *Text Analysis with R for Students of Literature* by Matthew L. Jockers.

### R and RStudio

There are at least two different kinds of environments that you can work with R in. Currently, the environment that I am using is a terminal *like* environment called vim. Vim works using a number of plugins and for my purposes, the main one is is Nvim-R. I am not going to recommend this if you do not have experience with it. Rather I will specify the basic method for getting started from scratch with no experience.

1. To download the current version of `R` head to [R](http://cran.at.r-project.org) and select on your operating system:
	1. For `Linux`, choose distribution and installer file.
2. Download the "Desktop" version of [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com)
	1. Follow the installation instructions
	2. Launch RStudio like any other program

## Creating the Materials 

Primarily, this tutorial is for my own personal purposes meaning that these instructions are ones that I've used to accomplish some task and do not want to forget.

### Billboard Music Charts

Ultimately, I am aiming to compare contextual sentiment expression across two genres of billboard music charts; namely Country and Hip-Hop R-n-B. To do this, it is helpful to identify a number of Billboard music charts that correspond to these styles. To do this, I've found the `billboard.py` python api by [Allen Guo](https://github.com/guoguo12) to be central. [It can be found here](https://github.com/guoguo12/billboard-charts). It is merely an api that gives you access to [Billboard.com](billboard.com)'s music charts.

First, find a chart:

`chart = billboard.ChartData('Hot-Country-Songs', year=2022)` selects a specific "year end chart" from Billboard.com which you can get [grouped by category here](https://www.billboard.com/charts) and the [year-end charts from here](https://www.billboard.com/charts/year-end).

**Next**

1. create new file with an extension `.py`

```
touch billboard.py
```

Enter these contents:

```
import billboard
import sys

chart = billboard.ChartData('Hot-Country-Songs', year=2021)

original_stdout = sys.stdout

with open('Hot-Country-Songs-2022.txt', 'w') as f:
    sys.stdout = f
    print(chart)
    sys.stdout = original_stdout

chart2 = billboard.ChartData('Country-Streaming-Songs', year=2022)

original2_stdout = sys.stdout

with open('Country-Streaming-Songs-2022.txt', 'w') as g:
    sys.stdout = g
    print(chart2)
    sys.stdout = original2_stdout

```

`import billboard` imports the billboard api while `import sys` imports various python functions that will help to maintain different aspects of your python runtime environment.

Next, `chart = billbarod.ChartData('Your chosen chart', year=your chosen year')` saves the chart data, artist and song to the variable "chart".

Then

```
with open('some text file.txt', 'w') as f:
    sys.stdout = f
    print(chart)
    sys.stdout = original_stdout
```

Here, you've created a new file "some text . . ." and stored it as `f`, and printed the "chart" data to f and saved the chart to "some text file . . .".

It should look something like this:

```
Country-Streaming-Songs chart (2021)
------------------------------------
1. 'Forever After All' by Luke Combs
2. 'Tennessee Whiskey' by Chris Stapleton
3. 'Starting Over' by Chris Stapleton
4. 'Wasted On You' by Morgan Wallen
5. 'I Hope' by Gabby Barrett
6. 'Fancy Like' by Walker Hayes
7. 'Whiskey Glasses' by Morgan Wallen
```

In my particular case, I ran a number of regex functions in vim so that I would only have the title and name of the song left which I saved as a comma delimited file `csv` like this:

```
I Hope,Gabby Barrett
The Bones,Maren Morris
Heartless,Diplo Presents Thomas Wesley Featuring Morgan Wallen
One Man Band,Old Dominion
10000 Hours,Dan + Shay & Justin Bieber
Tennessee Whiskey,Chris Stapleton
Whiskey Glasses,Morgan Wallen
```

Briefly, it should be noted that you can retrieve as many charts as you'd like with this code:

```
import billboard
import sys

## chart 1, Hot-Country-Songs year-end 2021

chart = billboard.ChartData('Hot-Country-Songs', year=2021)

original_stdout = sys.stdout

with open('Hot-Country-Songs-2022.txt', 'w') as f:
    sys.stdout = f
    print(chart)
    sys.stdout = original_stdout

## chart 2, Country-Streaming-Songs year-end 2021

chart2 = billboard.ChartData('Country-Streaming-Songs', year=2021)

original2_stdout = sys.stdout

with open('Country-Streaming-Songs-2022.txt', 'w') as g:
    sys.stdout = g
    print(chart2)
    sys.stdout = original2_stdout

```

Each set will save a chart to a new `.txt` file

### Retrieving the Music Lyrics

Retrieving music lyrics, I use [John W. Miller's](https://github.com/johnwmillr) excellent lyrics genuis api which in turn gets the lyrics you want from the website [genuis.com](https://genius.com/). The full instructions or its use can [be found here](https://lyricsgenius.readthedocs.io/en/master/).

Before you use this package, you will need to sign up for an account to get access to the api. An account authorizes your access to the [Genuis Api and can be done here](http://genius.com/api-clients).

First, install the api from your terminal command line:

```
pip install lyricsgenuis
```

Or get the latest version from [github](https://github.com/johnwmillr/LyricsGenius)

```
pip install git+https://github.com/johnwmillr/LyricsGenius.git
```

For standard usage, see the website above. In my particular case, I had someone help me write this script and currently, as of today, it still works:

```
# import lyricsgenius
import lyricsgenius
# import csv python package of functions for handling csv files
import csv

# the first line gives you access to lyrics genius
genius = lyricsgenius.Genius("your api")

# artist and song list
here = "your-saved-csv.csv"
# file you will save lyrics to
there = "new-lyrics-csv-file.csv (or .txt)"

# open new-lyrics-file for writing to
directionsFile = open(there, "+w")

# open artist song file to read from
with open(here, "r") as source:
    reader = csv.reader(source)
    songartistlist = list(reader)

# Admittedly, it gets a little vague here, but I think that what is happening is that you create two sets of lists to save each of your columns to. The column on the left lists the song titles "songlist = []" while the one on the right lists the artist's name "artistlist = []".

songlist = []
artistlist = []

# you then save the songartistlist as a variable called "i" each line is listed separately. Create a new variable called "j" where if an item (set of lyrics) is retured, then it is added to your object as a song

for i in songartistlist:
    count = 0
    for j in i:
        if count == 0:
            songlist.append(j)
            count += 1
        else:
            jsplit = j.split()
            j = jsplit[0]
            artistlist.append(j)

# while the additional (once again not utterly clear) will attach the song lyrics to the artist.

count1 = 0
songlyrics = []
for k in songartistlist:
    song = genius.search_song(songlist[count1], artistlist[count1])
    count1 += -1
    songlyrics.append(song.lyrics)

# save the lyrics file
directionsFile.writelines(songlyrics)
```

## Preparing the Files for Analysis

This section will extensively use Matthew Jocker's book. I've done analysis on similar sets before, but I am anticipating that Jocker's book will help clarify much of what I've attempted in the past.

### Creating the R environment

In the section of Jocker's book (1.5), he asks us to download the materials you would use to do his specific analysis. Instead, we will use the material we've just created.

```{r}


# We first set the working directory
# setwd("/home/redapemusic35/1-2021-22-Projects/Publications/Research-Projects/Music_Corpora/")

directory <- "/home/mreynolds/Music_Corpora/Song-Charts/Country-Streaming-Songs-2020-there-3.txt"

# load the first text file using the scan function. I am following Jocker's nomenclature, vectors will be denoted with a .v

# Jockers calls for the scan function but this gave me an error. Found on https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7797395/data-type-error-with-scan/7797830 that I should use 'read.csv' instead.

text.v <- read.csv(directory, sep="\n")

text.v[100:150,]

```

A quick mention is in order here. I cleaned up my original file. Since I am using Neovim, I was able to do this using a series of vim search and replace functions. Namely, there was a series of metadata variables such as `[Verse 1]` `[Intro]` highlighting the various verse blocks of the lyrics. using functions such as `%s /\[.*\]//gc` I was able to search these out can delete them. Further, each new song lyric began with `"last lyric line of previous songEmbedSong title of new song followed byLyric"`. It was pretty ugly. I replaced these lines like this: `%s /.*Embed\zeLyric/\[&\]/gc`. I think that is what I did, if it doesn't work for you, you could always play around with various searches. Just do not close the file so that you can always recover. 

I ended up with a file that began each new song lyric in this way: `[Song Title]`. I made a copy of the file and then deleted all of the song titles in the new copy. Although I no longer have the song title metadata in the file that I am working with, once I figure out how to record the metadata in a variable apart from the file I am working in, I can always do so.

One last change that I needed to make was a similar bit of housekeeping. My master file had a list of songs whose lyrics did not get included. These were not country song lyrics and I think that because of that, my script did not download the lyrics to these songs. I am not sure why they were there.

I now no longer have any metadata to contend with and after an extensive check, I was able to confirm that this is true.

## Reprocessing the Content

```{r}
# load packages

library(sentimentr)
library(magrittr)
library(dplyr)

# lowercase file contents
lyrics.lower.v <- tolower(text.v)

#split contents into sentences by line

lyric.sentences.l <- strsplit(lyrics.lower.v, "\\]")
lyric.sentences.l <- unlist(lyric.sentences.l)

not.blanks.v <- which(lyric.sentences.l!="")
not.blanks.v


# look at original 
lyric.sentences.l <- lyric.sentences.l[not.blanks.v]
lyric.sentences.l

# separate into words 
lyric.words.l <- strsplit(lyrics.lower.v, "\\W")

lyric.words.l <- unlist(lyric.words.l)

# delete blank spaces
not.blanks.v <- which(lyric.words.l!="")
not.blanks.v[1:10]

# show result for inspection

lyric.words.l <- lyric.words.l[not.blanks.v]
lyric.words.l[1:100]

# look for individual words
length(lyric.words.l[which(lyric.words.l=="us")])
length(lyric.words.l[which(lyric.words.l=="me")])
length(lyric.words.l[which(lyric.words.l=="you")])
length(lyric.words.l[which(lyric.words.l=="we")])
length(lyric.words.l[which(lyric.words.l=="love")])
length(lyric.words.l[which(lyric.words.l=="i")])
love.words <- lyric.words.l[which(lyric.words.l=="love")]

love.words

# look for sentences containing certain words

# length(lyric.sentences.l[which(lyric.sentences.l==".*(^love)")])

# more than half the songs contain the word love

length(lyric.sentences.l[grep("love",lyric.sentences.l)])

# is love being used positively or negatively?

love.lyrics <- lyric.sentences.l[grep("love",lyric.sentences.l)]
love.lyrics

# there are 6 songs wherein the word love is used, they have a negative sentiment

sentiment(love.lyrics)
```

```{r}

sentiment(love.lyrics)

```
